## Features

- **Visual Diff Generation** - Pixel-level comparison highlighting exactly what changed
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - GPT-4o analyzes before/after designs to detect and annotate all changes
- **Interactive Annotations** - Drag-and-drop annotation numbers, add/edit/delete change descriptions
- **Smart Export** - Save comparison images with optional design changes panel
- **Team-Ready Formats** - One-click copy for Slack and Linear with numbered annotations
- **Zero Setup** - Just drag and drop PNG images
- **Native macOS Experience** - Beautiful dark theme with smooth animations

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later

## Usage

   - Drag & drop or click to upload before/after PNG images
   - Works best with UI screenshots at similar sizes

2. **Analyze**
   - Click "Analyze" to generate visual diff and AI-powered change detection
   - AI automatically identifies and positions annotation numbers on changes

3. **Edit Annotations**
   - Drag annotation numbers to adjust their positions
   - Click "+" to add new annotations
   - Double-click text to edit descriptions
   - Delete annotations you don't need
